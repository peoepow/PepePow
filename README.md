# Pepepow Mining Tool üöÄ

## Overview üìñ

This Rust project is a fully-functional tool for participating in Ethereum's Pepepow mining process. It offers a Rust-based implementation for connecting to the Ethereum blockchain, generating nonces, and submitting transactions upon discovering a valid nonce. Ideal for those interested in Ethereum mining or exploring the mechanics of blockchain interactions in Rust.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Mining Functionality**: Generates nonces and compares the resulting hash with a target, mirroring Ethereum's actual mining process.
- **Parallel Mining Workers**: Leverages Rust's concurrency model with async/await and thread pools for deploying multiple mining workers, boosting the probability of finding a valid nonce.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Interfaces with a specified Ethereum smart contract to retrieve the current mining challenge and difficulty.
- **Nonce Submission and Transaction Handling**: Submits the mining solution to the Ethereum network and manages the transaction process after identifying a valid nonce.

## Installation and Setup üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Install Rust**: Ensure you have Rust 1.73 or newer installed.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Download this repository to your machine.
3. **Build the Project**:
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run `cargo build --release` to build the release version of the executable.

## Usage üöÄ

1. **Configuration**:

   - Configure your Ethereum private key and contract address in a configuration file or environment variables.
   - Adjust the number of mining workers as desired.

2. **Running the Tool**:
   - Start the tool by running `./target/release/pepepow --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY --contract-address CONTRACT_ADDRESS --worker-count COUNT` in your terminal.
   - Optional flags or environment variables can be used for specific configurations.
